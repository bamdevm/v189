abstract: "In this work, we propose a multi-armed bandit-based framework for identifying a compact set of\r informative data instances (i.e., the prototypes) from a source dataset S that best represents a given target set T. Prototypical\rexamples of a given dataset offer interpretable insights into the underlying data distribution and assist in\r example-based reasoning, thereby influencing every sphere of human decision-making. Current state-of-the-art prototype\r selection approaches require O(|S||T|) similarity comparisons between source and target data points, which becomes\r prohibitively expensive for large-scale settings. We propose to mitigate this limitation by employing stochastic greedy\r search in the space of prototypical examples and multi-armed bandits for reducing the number of similarity\r comparisons. Our randomized algorithm, ProtoBandit, identifies a set of k prototypes incurring O(|S|) similarity \rcomparisons, which is independent of the size of the target set. An interesting outcome of our analysis is for the\r k-medoids clustering problem (T=S setting) in which we show that our algorithm ProtoBandit approximates the BUILD step\r solution of the partitioning around medoids (PAM) method in O(k|S|) complexity. Empirically, we observe that\r ProtoBandit reduces the number of similarity computation calls by several orders of magnitudes (100-1000 times) while\r obtaining solutions similar in quality to those from state-of-the-art approaches."

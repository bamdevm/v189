  abstract =	 {In the real-world, most images are saved in JPEG
                  format, so many forged images are partially or
                  totally composed of JPEG images and then saved in
                  JPEG format again. In this case, exposing forged
                  images can be accomplished by the detection of
                  double JPEG compressions. Although the detection
                  methods of double JPEG compressions have greatly
                  improved, they rely on handcrafted features of image
                  patches and cannot locate forgery at pixel-level. To
                  break this limitation, we propose an end-to-end
                  feature-fusion network (FF-Net) for double
                  compression detection and forgery localization. We
                  find that JPEG compression fingerprint primarily
                  exists on the high-frequency component of an image,
                  and the singly and doubly compression yield
                  different fingerprints. Therefore, we design two
                  encoders cooperatively to learn the compression
                  fingerprint directly from the whole image. A decoder
                  is deployed to locate the regions with different
                  compression fingerprints at pixel-level based on the
                  learned compression fingerprint. The experiment
                  results verify that the proposed FF-Net can detect
                  and locate the forged regions more accurately than
                  these existing detection methods. Besides, it has a
                  good generalization ability that the network trained
                  on one compression case can work in numerous
                  compression cases. Moreover, it can detect different
                  local forgeries, including copy-move, splicing, and
                  object-removal.}

                  address this challenge with resource-intensive
                  contextualized alignment, which assumes the
                  availability of large parallel data, thereby leaving
                  under-represented language communities behind. In
                  this work, we attribute the data hungriness of
                  previous alignment techniques to two limitations:
                  (i) the inability to sufficiently leverage data and
                  (ii) these techniques are not trained properly. To
                  address these issues, we introduce supervised and
                  unsupervised density-based approaches named Real-NVP
                  and GAN-Real-NVP, driven by Normalizing Flow, to
                  perform alignment, both dissecting the alignment of
                  multilingual subspaces into density matching and

                  with our validation criteria in order to guide the
                  training process. Our experiments encompass 16
                  alignments, including our approaches, evaluated
                  across 6 language pairs, synthetic data and 5 NLP
                  tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
                  approaches in the scenarios of limited and no
                  parallel data. First, our supervised approach
                  trained on 20k parallel data (sentences) mostly
                  surpasses Joint-Align and InfoXLM trained on over
                  100k parallel sentences. Second, parallel data can
                  be removed without sacrificing performance when
                  integrating our unsupervised approach in our
                  bootstrapping procedure, which is theoretically
                  motivated to enforce equality of multilingual

                  robustness of single-label classification against

                  to the unbalanced distributions of labels and the

                  fitting networks is through constrained Neural
                  Architecture Search (NAS). However, previous methods
                  use complicated predictors for the accuracy of the
                  network.  Those predictors are hard to interpret and
                  sensitive to many hyperparameters to be tuned,
                  hence, the resulting accuracy of the generated
                  models is often harmed.  In this work we resolve
                  this by introducing Bilinear Interpretable Neural
                  Architecture Search (BINAS), that is based on an
                  accurate and simple bilinear formulation of both an

                  more effective at deeper stages of the network and
                  at the beginning of each resolution stage.  Our
                  experiments show that BINAS generates comparable to
                  or better architectures than other state-of-the-art
                  NAS methods within a reduced search cost for each

                  widely studied under the stationary

                  industrial applications, this assumption is often
                  unrealistic because the distributions of rewards may
                  change over time. In this paper, we consider the
                  piece-wise iid non-stationary stochastic multi-armed
                  bandit problem with unknown change-points and we
                  focus on the change of mean setup. To solve the
                  latter, we propose a change-point based framework
                  where we study a class of change-detection based
                  optimal bandit policies that actively detects
                  change-point using the restarted Bayesian online
                  change-point detector and then restarts the bandit
                  indices. Analytically, in the context of regret
                  minimization, our proposal achieves a
                  $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{A T K_T })$ regret upper-bound
                  where $K_T$ is the overall number of change-points
                  up to the horizon $T$ and $A$ is the number of
                  arms. The derived bound matches the existing lower
                  bound for abruptly changing environments. Finally,
                  we demonstrate the cumulative regret reduction of
                  the our proposal over synthetic Bernoulli rewards as

                  problem, degrading a model’s generality to unseen
                  tasks. In Federated Learning (FL), learned model
                  parameters are shared to train a global model that
                  leverages the underlying knowledge across client
                  models trained on separate data
                  domains. Nonetheless, the data confidentiality of FL
                  hinders the effectiveness of traditional domain
                  adaptation methods that require prior knowledge of
                  different domain data. We propose a new federated
                  domain generalization method called Federated
                  Knowledge Alignment (FedKA). FedKA leverages feature
                  distribution matching in a global workspace such
                  that the global model can learn domain-invariant
                  client features under the constraint of unknown
                  client data. FedKA employs a federated voting
                  mechanism that generates target domain pseudo-labels
                  based on the consensus from clients to facilitate
                  global model fine-tuning. We performed extensive
                  experiments, including an ablation study, to
                  evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
                  both image and text classification tasks using
                  different model architectures. The empirical results
                  show that FedKA achieves performance gains of 8.8\%
                  and 3.5\% in Digit-Five and Office-Caltech10,
                  respectively, and a gain of 0.7\% in Amazon Review
                  with extremely limited training data. Moreover, we
                  studied the effectiveness of FedKA in alleviating
                  the negative transfer of FL based on a new criterion

                  high dimensional observations. Recent studies have
                  shown that CNNs have strong inductive bias towards
                  image styles rather than content (i.e. agent

In this paper, a HAR model with positional attention (PA), termed as PA-HAR, is presented. To enhance the features in both sensor's channel and temporal dimensions, we propose to split the sensor signals into two 1D features to capture the long-range dependency along the temporal-axis and signal's cross-channel information along the sensor's channel-axis. Furthermore, we embed the features with positional information by encoding the generated features into pairs of temporal-aware and sensor's channel-aware attention maps and weighting the input feature maps. Extensive experiments based on five public datasets demonstrate that the proposed PA-HAR algorithm achieves a competitive performance in HAR related tasks compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.}

                  cows on grassland, CNN can erroneously extract grass
                  as the feature of the class cow. There are two main
                  limitations to this kind of learning: firstly, in
                  many false-negative cases, correct features will not
                  be used, and secondly, in false-positive cases the
                  system will lack accountability. There is no
                  implicit way to inform CNN to learn the features
                  that are justifiable from a human perspective to
                  resolve these issues. In this paper, we argue that
                  if we provide domain knowledge to guide the learning
                  process of CNN, it is possible to reliably learn the
                  justifiable features. We propose a systematic yet
                  simple mechanism to incorporate domain knowledge to
                  guide the learning process of the CNNs to extract
                  justifiable features. The flip side is that it needs
                  additional input. However, we have shown that even
                  with minimal additional input our method can
                  effectively propagate the knowledge within a class
                  during training. We demonstrate that justifiable
                  features not only enhance accuracy but also demand
                  less amount of data and training time. Moreover, we
                  also show that the proposed method is more robust
                  against perturbational changes in the input images.}

                  quality caricatures with rich texture/color and
                  plausible exaggeration is important. Previous
                  methods often respectively deal with the shape
                  transformation and texture/color style. We argue
                  that shape transformation can be treated as same as
                  texture/color. Thereby, shape transformation and
                  texture/color can be transferred at the same
                  time. In this paper, we proposed a new method namely
                  AdsSe-GAN for photo-to-caricature generation, which
                  consists of a new normalization function called
                  AdaSLIN and a new semi-cycle consistency loss. The
                  AdaSLIN adaptively selects Layer Normalization or
                  Instance Normalization to simultaneously transfer
                  texture/color and shape transformation. Besides we
                  present semi-cycle consistency loss which only
                  imposes L1 norm on caricature-to-photo process,
                  which is different from existing methods that apply
                  cycle consistency loss to preserve the original

                  caricature, taking no account of the cycle
                  restriction makes our model generate caricature with
                  more distinct exaggeration and higher
                  quality. Experimental results on a public caricature

                  globally. Such an episode often has mild or varied
                  symptoms, making it hard to diagnose and respond in
                  a timely manner. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is used
                  to analyze the heart's electrical activity and,
                  through this help, clinicians detect and localize a
                  heart attack. However, interpretation of the ECG is
                  made manually by trained professionals. In order to
                  make this diagnosis more efficient, multiple methods
                  have tried to automate the MI detection and
                  localization process. In this work, we aim to create
                  a more effective method of MI detection by
                  restructuring the localization as a multi-label
                  classification (MLC) problem, in which one set of

                  superior performance of existing methods for SBR,
                  there are still several limitations: (i) Almost all
                  existing works concentrate on single interest
                  extraction and fail to disentangle multiple
                  interests of user, which easily results in
                  suboptimal representations for SBR. (ii)
                  Furthermore, previous methods also ignore the
                  multi-form temporal information, which is
                  significant signal to obtain current intention for
                  SBR. To address the limitations mentioned above, we
                  propose a novel method, called Temporal aware
                  Multi-Interest Graph Neural Network (TMI-GNN) to
                  disentangle multi-interest and yield refined
                  intention representations with the injection of two
                  level temporal information. Specifically, by
                  appending multiple interest nodes, we construct a
                  multi-interest graph for current session, and adopt
                  the GNNs to model the item-item relation to capture
                  adjacent item transitions, item-interest relation to
                  disentangle the multi-interests, and interest-item
                  relation to refine the item
                  representation. Meanwhile, we incorporate item-level
                  time interval signals to guide the item information
                  propagation, and interest-level time distribution
                  information to assist the scattering of interest
                  information. Experiments on three benchmark datasets

                  its style. Most existing methods encode the texture
                  of the whole reference human image into a latent
                  space, and then utilize a decoder to synthesize the
                  image texture of the target pose. However, it is
                  difficult to recover the detailed texture of the
                  whole human image. To alleviate this problem, we
                  propose a method by decoupling the human body into
                  several parts (\emph{e.g.}, hair, face, hands, feet,

                  the generated images. In addition, we design a
                  multi-head attention-based module for PGHIS. Because
                  most convolutional neural network-based methods have
                  difficulty in modeling long-range dependency due to
                  the convolutional operation, the long-range modeling
                  capability of attention mechanism is more suitable

                  task, especially for sharp pose

                  several projectors leading to improved stability of
                  the results. We provide several experiments

                  Secure Multi-party Computation (SMPC) to cluster the

                  widely used in applications, it suffers from some
                  unreasonable properties. For example, it is not a

                  though existing imputation methods have a number of
                  limitations. Single imputation methods such as
                  matrix completion methods do not adequately account
                  for imputation uncertainty and hence would yield
                  improper statistical inference. In contrast,
                  multiple imputation (MI) methods allow for proper

                  detection. Heteroscedasticity here refers to the

                  sample can be different, as opposed to conventional
                  approaches that use the same value for the entire

                  instance, OT is a popular loss function that
                  quantifies the discrepancy between an empirical
                  distribution and a parametric model. Recently, an
                  entropic penalty term and the celebrated Sinkhorn
                  algorithm have been commonly used to approximate the
                  original OT in a computationally efficient
                  way. However, since the Sinkhorn algorithm runs a
                  projection associated with the Kullback-Leibler
                  divergence, it is often vulnerable to outliers. To

                  our algorithm helps estimate a probability
                  distribution robustly even in the presence of
                  outliers. In addition, our proposed method can

                  variational BNNs via cost-effective Bayesian
                  fine-tuning. Technically, we develop a modularized
                  implementation for the learning of variational BNNs,
                  and refurbish the generally applicable exemplar
                  reparameterization trick through exemplar
                  parallelization to efficiently reduce the gradient
                  variance in stochastic variational inference. Based
                  on the the lightweight Bayesian learning paradigm,
                  we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of
                  benchmarks, and show that our method can
                  consistently induce posteriors with higher quality
                  than competitive baselines, yet significantly

                  model compression technique. Recently, several works
                  apply differentiable neural architectural search
                  (NAS) methods to mixed-precision quantization (MPQ)
                  and achieve encouraging results. However, the nature
                  of differentiable architecture search can lead to
                  the Matthew Effect in the mixed-precision. The
                  candidates with higher bit-widths would be trained
                  maturely earlier while the candidates with lower
                  bit-widths may never have the chance to express the
                  desired function. To address this issue, we propose
                  a novel mixed-precision quantization framework. The
                  mixed-precision search is resolved as a distribution
                  learning problem, which alleviates the Matthew
                  effect and improves the generalization
                  ability. Meanwhile, different from generic
                  differentiable NAS methods, search space will grow
                  rapidly as the depth of the network increases in the
                  mixed-precision quantization search. This makes the
                  supernet harder to train and the search process
                  unstable. To this end, we add a skip connection with
                  a gradually decreasing architecture weight between
                  convolutional layers in the supernet to improve
                  robustness. The skip connection will help the
                  optimization of the search process and will not
                  participate in the bit width competition. Extensive
                  experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the
                  effectiveness of the proposed methods. For example,
                  when quantizing ResNet-50 on ImageNet, we achieve a
                  state-of-the-art 156.10x Bitops compression rate
                  while maintaining a 75.87$\%$ accuracy.}

                  risks to many vision-based applications (such as

                  (AdvLS), which optimizes the physical parameters of

                  physical attacks. It realizes robust and covert
                  physical attack by using low-cost laser

                  superior adversarial attack migration. The

                  attention recently. Among existing approaches, the
                  metric-based method aims to train an embedding
                  network that can make similar samples close while
                  dissimilar samples as far as possible and achieves
                  promising results. FSL is characterized by using
                  only a few images to train a model that can
                  generalize to novel classes in image classification
                  problems, but this setting makes it difficult to
                  learn the visual features that can identify the
                  images' appearance variations. The model training is
                  likely to move in the wrong direction, as the images
                  in an identical semantic class may have dissimilar
                  appearances, whereas the images in different
                  semantic classes may share a similar appearance. We
                  argue that FSL can benefit from additional semantic
                  features to learn discriminative feature
                  representations. Thus, this study proposes a
                  multi-task learning approach to view semantic
                  features of label text as an auxiliary task to help
                  boost the performance of the FSL task. Our proposed
                  model uses word-embedding representations as
                  semantic features to help train the embedding
                  network and a semantic cross-attention module to
                  bridge the semantic features into the typical visual
                  modal. The proposed approach is simple, but produces
                  excellent results. We apply our proposed approach to
                  two previous metric-based FSL methods, all of which
                  can substantially improve performance. The source

                  data? Machine learning models that can cope with
                  domain shift are essential for real-world scenarios
                  with often changing data distributions. Prior DG

                  possibly has open-class samples. The inborn
                  challenge is to detect the open-class samples in the
                  test phase. Pioneering studies could be viewed as
                  dependent-detector-based methods. They cleverly
                  design efficient uncertainty metrics (\eg,
                  confidence, entropy, distance) based on the outputs
                  of domain adaptation models (predictor) to detect
                  open-class samples. However, they have a pain point
                  in setting extremely-sensitive and task-dependent
                  thresholds on the uncertainty metrics to filter
                  open-class samples. To bypass this pain point, we
                  propose a semi-separated-detector-based method,
                  Semi-Separated Uncertainty Adversarial Learning
                  (SNAIL). We build a semi-separated uncertainty
                  decision-maker to enable sensitive-threshold-free
                  detection. It receives multiple uncertainty metrics
                  as attributes and separately learns the thresholds
                  of uncertainty metrics in a multi-level decision
                  rule. For some challenging tasks, the uncertainty
                  margins between common and open classes are subtle,
                  leading to difficulty learning optimal decision
                  rules. We present the uncertainty separation loss to
                  enlarge the uncertainty margin. Further, forcibly
                  aligning the distributions could incorrectly align
                  the open classes to common classes.  Thanks to the
                  open-class detection strategy, we design the
                  conditional-weighted adversarial loss that
                  adversarially and selectively matches the feature
                  distributions to defeat the distribution
                  misalignment problem. Extensive experiments show
                  that SNAIL remarkably outperforms the
                  state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, with
                  over 25\% improvements in open-class detection
                  accuracy for some tasks.}

                  an unprecedented amount of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data
                  is available. The scale of this data has out-paced
                  traditional methods for its analysis, while
                  machine-learning approaches aimed at clustering and
                  classification of SARS-CoV-2 variants is becoming an
                  attractive alternative. Since the SARS-CoV-2 genome
                  is highly dimensional, considering the much smaller
                  spike region can save a great deal of processing.
                  As the spike protein mediates the attachment of the
                  coronavirus to the host cell, most of the newer and
                  more contagious variants can be characterized by
                  alterations to the spike protein; hence it is often
                  sufficient for characterizing the different
                  SARS-CoV-2 variants. Another important consideration
                  is to have a fast feature embedding generation,
                  which is the subject of this work.  Applying any
                  machine learning (ML) model to a biological sequence
                  requires first transforming it into a fixed-length
                  (numerical) form. While there exist several compact
                  embeddings for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences,
                  the generation process is computationally expensive
                  since the features, added to the resulting vectors,
                  are indexed in a na\"{i}ve fashion.  To solve this
                  problem, we propose a fast and alignment-free
                  hashing-based approach to design a fixed-length
                  feature embedding for spike protein sequences,
                  called Hashing2Vec, which can be used as input to
                  any standard ML model. Using real-world data, we
                  show that the proposed embedding is not only
                  efficient to compute but also outperforms current
                  state-of-the-art embedding methods in terms of
                  classification accuracy. In terms of runtime, we
                  achieve up to a 99.8\% improvement in the
                  Hashing2Vec-based embedding generation as compared
                  to the baselines on a set of 7K spike amino acid
                  sequences. It also outperforms the baselines on this
                  data in terms of predictive performance and achieves
                  accuracy and ROC-AUC scores of 86\% and 84.4\%,
                  respectively.}

                  teams. To this purpose, spatial interpolation
                  methods have been developed to estimate the value of
                  unobserved points linearly from neighbor observed
                  values, i.e., inverse distance weighting and
                  Kriging. Recently, realistic spatial continuous
                  environmental data with various scenarios can be
                  generated by 3D finite difference methods with a
                  high-resolution structure model. It enables us to
                  collect supervised data even for unobserved
                  points. Along this line, we propose a framework of

                  advanced deep inpainting methods where we treat
                  spatially distributed observed points as a masked
                  image and non-linearly expand them through
                  convolutional encoder-decoder networks. However, the
                  property of translation invariance would avoid
                  locally fine-grained interpolation since the
                  relation between the target and surrounding
                  observation points varies over regions due to its
                  topography and subsurface structure. To overcome
                  this problem, we propose introducing
                  position-dependent convolution where kernel weights
                  are adjusted depending on their position on an image
                  based on the trainable position-feature map. We show
                  the effectiveness of our proposed method, called,
                  PoDIM (Position-dependent Deep Inpainting Method),

                  be a harder comparison task? While simple, this
                  question can be meaningful for few-shot
                  classification. Few-shot learning enables trained
                  models to recognize unseen classes through just a
                  few labelled samples. As such, trained few-shot
                  models usually have to possess the ability to assess
                  the similarity degree between the unlabelled and
                  labelled samples. In each few-shot learning episode,
                  a combination of the labelled support set and
                  unlabelled query set are sampled from the training
                  dataset for model-training. In the episodic settings
                  of few-shot learning, most algorithms draw the data
                  samples uniformly at random for training. However,
                  this approach disregards concepts of difficulty of
                  each training episode, which may make a difference.
                  After all, it is usually easier to differentiate
                  between a dog and a hot dog, versus the dog and a
                  wolf.  Therefore, in this paper, we delve into the
                  concept of episodic difficulty, or difficulty of
                  each training episode, discovering several insights
                  and proposing strategies to utilize the difficulty.
                  Firstly, defining episodic difficulty as a training
                  loss, we find and study the correlation between
                  episodic difficulty and visual similarity among data
                  samples in each episode.  Secondly, we assess the
                  respective usefulness of easy and difficult episodes
                  for the training process.  Lastly, based on the
                  assessment, we design a curriculum for few-shot
                  learning to support training with incremental
                  difficulty.  We observe that such an approach can
                  achieve faster convergence for few-shot algorithms,
                  reducing the average training time by around 50\%.
                  It can also make meta-learning algorithms achieve an
                  increase in final testing accuracy scores.}

                  applications. Since data of different modalities
                  might lie in completely distinct spaces, it is very
                  challenging to perform effective fusion and analysis
                  from asynchronous multimodal streams. Most of
                  previous works focused on aligned fusion, which is
                  unpractical in real-world scenarios. The recent
                  Multimodal Transformer (MulT) approach attends to
                  model the correlations between elements from
                  different modalities in an unaligned
                  manner. However, it collects temporal information by
                  self-attention transformer which is a sequence
                  model, implying that interactions across distinct
                  time steps are not sufficient. In this paper, we

                  Network with dimension-aware fusion (CITN-DAF),
                  which enables parallel computation of different
                  modalities among different time steps and alleviates
                  inter-modal temporal sensitivity while preserving
                  intra-modal semantic order. By incorporating
                  circulant matrices into the cross-modal attention
                  mechanism, CITN-DAF is aimed to examine all
                  conceivable interactions between vectors of
                  different modalities. In addition, a dimension-aware
                  fusion method is presented, which projects feature
                  representations into different subspaces for an
                  in-depth fusion. We evaluate CITN-DAF on three

                  aerial vehicle (UAV). However, deep learning
                  (DL)-based trackers hardly achieve real-time
                  tracking on a single CPU despite their high tracking
                  precision. To the contrary, discriminative
                  correlation filters (DCF)-based trackers have high
                  efficiency but their precision is barely
                  satisfactory. Despite the precision is inferior,
                  DCF-based trackers instead of DL-based ones are
                  widely applied in UAV tracking to trade precision
                  for efficiency. This paper aims to improve the
                  efficiency of the DL-based tracker SiamFC++, in
                  particular, for UAV tracking using the model
                  compression technique, i.e., rank-based filter
                  pruning, which has not been well explored
                  before. Meanwhile, to combat the potential loss of
                  precision caused by pruning we exploit disentangled
                  representation learning to disentangle the output
                  feature of the backbone into two parts: the
                  identity-related features and the identity-unrelated
                  features. Only the identity-related features are
                  used for subsequent classification and regression
                  tasks to improve the effectiveness of the feature
                  representation. With the proposed disentangled
                  representation in pruning, we achieved higher
                  precisions when compressing the original model
                  SiamFC++ with a global pruning ratio of
                  0.5. Extensive experiments on four public UAV

                  demonstrate that our CSCE-Net is superior to the

                  multi-source heterogeneous data offers many exciting
                  challenges and opportunities for improving the
                  inference of conditional average treatment
                  effects. In this paper, we investigate homogeneous
                  and heterogeneous causal data fusion problems under
                  a general setting that allows for the presence of
                  source-specific covariates. We provide a direct
                  learning framework for integrating multi-source data
                  that separates the treatment effect from other
                  nuisance functions, and achieves double robustness
                  against certain misspecification. To improve
                  estimation precision and stability, we propose a
                  causal information-aware weighting function
                  motivated by theoretical insights from the
                  semiparametric efficiency theory; it assigns larger
                  weights to samples containing more causal
                  information with high interpretability. We introduce
                  a two-step algorithm, the weighted multi-source
                  direct learner, based on constructing a
                  pseudo-outcome and regressing it on covariates under
                  a weighted least square criterion; it offers us a
                  powerful tool for causal data fusion, enjoying the
                  advantages of easy implementation, double robustness
                  and model flexibility. In simulation studies, we
                  demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed

                  the feature effect, resolving misleading estimations
                  due to OOD sampling. Finally, we formally prove

                  trades and information asymmetry, the understanding

                  relatively unexplored by academics across

                  simulations of limit order markets and use them to
                  design a high-frequency market making agent using
                  Deep Recurrent Q-Networks. Our approach outperforms
                  a prominent benchmark strategy from literature,
                  which uses temporal-difference reinforcement
                  learning to design market making agents. Using the
                  simulation framework, we analyse how the maker-take
                  fee, a feature of market design, affects market
                  quality and the agent's profitability. The agents

                  for heterophily. In heterophily graphs, labels of
                  neighboring nodes can be uniformly distributed. In
                  such case, aggregated features by existing GNNs will
                  be always similar regardless of the label of
                  ego-node and fail to capture useful information for
                  a node classification task. Since the existing
                  methods basically ignore label distribution around
                  the ego-node, we attempt to handle heterophily
                  graphs through dynamic aggregations so that nodes
                  with similar vicinity characteristics exhibit
                  similar behavior. In particular, we adjust the
                  amount of aggregation based on the features
                  generated by higher-order neighbors, since they
                  reflect the label distribution around each
                  ego-node. By doing this, we can take the influence
                  of distant nodes into account while adapting local
                  structures of each node. Extensive experiments
                  demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher
                  performance in heterophily graphs by up to 14.68\%

                  popular solution to this problem is to adapt a
                  pre-trained model to novel domains using only
                  unlabeled data. In this paper, we focus on a
                  challenging variant of this problem, where access to
                  the original source data is restricted. While fully
                  test-time adaptation (FTTA) and unsupervised domain
                  adaptation (UDA) are closely related, the advances
                  in UDA are not readily applicable to TTA, since most
                  UDA methods require access to the source
                  data. Hence, we propose a new approach, CATTAn, that
                  bridges UDA and FTTA, by relaxing the need to access
                  entire source data, through a novel deep subspace

                  games with an additional component, `noisy
                  preferences'. Moreover, such noisy preferences are
                  available only for a sample of coalitions. We
                  propose a multiplicative noise model (equivalent to
                  an additive noise model) and obtain the prediction
                  probability, defined as the probability that the
                  estimated PAC core-stable partition of the
                  \emph{noisy} game is also PAC core-stable for the
                  \emph{unknown noise-free} game.  This prediction
                  probability depends on the probability of a
                  combinatorial construct called an `agreement
                  event'. We explicitly obtain the agreement
                  probability for $n$ agent noisy game with $l\geq 2$
                  support noise distribution. For a user-given
                  satisfaction value on this probability, we identify
                  the noise regimes for which an estimated partition
                  is noise robust; that is, it is PAC core-stable in
                  both the noisy and noise-free games. We obtain
                  similar robustness results when the estimated
                  partition is not PAC core-stable. These noise
                  regimes correspond to the level sets of the
                  agreement probability function and are non-convex
                  sets. Moreover, an important fact is that the
                  prediction probability can be high even if high
                  noise values occur with a high probability. Further,
                  for a class of top-responsive hedonic games, we
                  obtain the bounds on the extra noisy samples
                  required to get noise robustness with a user-given
                  satisfaction value.  We completely solve the noise
                  robustness problem of a $2$ agent hedonic game. In
                  particular, we obtain the prediction probability
                  function for $l=2$ and $l=3$ noise support
                  cases. For $l=2$, the prediction probability is
                  convex in noise probability, but the noise robust
                  regime is non-convex. Its minimum value, called the
                  safety value, is 0.62; so, below 0.62, the noise
                  robust regime is the entire probability
                  simplex. However, for $l \geq 3$, the prediction
                  probability is non-convex; so, the safety value is
                  the global minima of a non-convex function and is

Prototypical examples of a given dataset offer interpretable insights into the underlying data distribution and assist in example-based reasoning, thereby influencing every sphere of human decision-making. Current state-of-the-art prototype selection approaches require O(|S||T|) similarity comparisons between source and target data points, which becomes prohibitively expensive for large-scale settings. We propose to mitigate this limitation by employing stochastic greedy search in the space of prototypical examples and multi-armed bandits for reducing the number of similarity comparisons. Our randomized algorithm, ProtoBandit, identifies a set of k prototypes incurring O(|S|) similarity comparisons, which is independent of the size of the target set. An interesting outcome of our analysis is for the k-medoids clustering problem (T=S setting) in which we show that our algorithm ProtoBandit approximates the BUILD step solution of the partitioning around medoids (PAM) method in O(k|S|) complexity. Empirically, we observe that ProtoBandit reduces the number of similarity computation calls by several orders of magnitudes (100-1000 times) while obtaining solutions similar in quality to those from state-of-the-art approaches.}

                  learn task-specific feature embeddings by fully
                  capturing rich information cross videos in each
                  episodic task. Furthermore, we utilize semantic

                  additional supervisory information to improve the
                  generalization ability of the network. By this

                  behavior of the algorithm under the noisy updates,
                  where noises can be generated by a stochastic
                  process or could be chosen adversarially. The noisy
                  Riemannian gradient descent has a broad range of
                  applications in machine learning and statistics,
                  e.g., streaming principal component analysis or
                  privacy-preserving spectral analysis. In particular,
                  we demonstrate the usefulness of our convergence
                  bound with a new eigengap-dependent sample
                  complexity of the inexact Riemannian stochastic
                  recursive gradient algorithm, which utilizes
                  mini-batch gradients instead of full gradients in
                  outer loops. Our robust convergence paradigm
                  strictly improves the state-of-the-art sample
                  complexity in terms of the gap dependence.}

  abstract =	 {In recent years, semantic segmentation has shown
                  very good performance in daytime scenes. But in
                  nighttime scenes, semantic segmentation greatly
                  reduces its accuracy. Due to the lack of large-scale
                  nighttime semantic segmentation datasets, it is
                  difficult to directly train segmentation models for
                  nighttime scenes. Therefore, it becomes important to
                  adapt the daytime scene segmentation model to the
                  nighttime scene without directly using the nighttime
                  scene segmentation dataset. In this paper, we
                  propose a framework based on unsupervised learning
                  and cross attention. The proposed method fuses
                  supervised daytime scenes and unsupervised nighttime
                  scenes, the supervision information in the daytime
                  scene and the texture information specific to the
                  nighttime scene are fully utilized, and the model is
                  adapted to both the daytime scene and the nighttime
                  scene. Consistency regulation is used to make
                  segmentation model adapt to the complex and
                  changeable night scene texture and illumination. In
                  view of the coarse correspondence of static objects
                  between day and night image pairs in the Dark Zurich
                  dataset, cross attention is proposed to make the
                  model pay more attention to the parts of the night
                  scene which are similar to the daytime
                  scene. Extensive experiments on Dark Zurich and
                  Nighttime Driving datasets show that our method
                  obtains better performance in nighttime semantic
                  segmentation.}

                  S-IntroVAE have excelled in image generation and
                  reconstruction tasks. The principal characteristic
                  of introspective models is the adversarial learning
                  of VAE, where the encoder attempts to distinguish
                  between the real and the fake (i.e., synthesized)
                  images. However, due to the unavailability of an
                  effective metric to evaluate the difference between
                  the real and the fake images, the posterior collapse
                  and the vanishing gradient problem still exist,
                  reducing the fidelity of the synthesized images. In
                  this paper, we propose a new variation of IntroVAE
                  called Adversarial Similarity Distance Introspective
                  Variational Autoencoder (AS-IntroVAE). We
                  theoretically analyze the vanishing gradient problem
                  and construct a new Adversarial Similarity Distance
                  (AS-Distance) using the 2-Wasserstein distance and
                  the kernel trick. With weight annealing on
                  AS-Distance and KL-Divergence, the AS-IntroVAE are
                  able to generate stable and high-quality images. The
                  posterior collapse problem is addressed by making
                  per-batch attempts to transform the image so that it
                  better fits the prior distribution in the latent
                  space. Compared with the per-image approach, this
                  strategy fosters more diverse distributions in the
                  latent space, allowing our model to produce images
                  of great diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
                  benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
                  AS-IntroVAE on image generation and reconstruction
                  tasks.}

  Author =	 {Buet-Golfouse, Francois and Utyagulov, Islam},
  pages =	 {112-136},
  Crossref =	 {acml22},
  Abstract =	 {Previous literature has shown that bias mitigating
                  algorithms were sometimes prone to overfitting and
                  had poor out-of-sample generalisation. This paper is
                  first and foremost concerned with establishing a
                  mathematical framework to tackle the specific issue
                  of generalisation. Throughout this work, we consider
                  fairness trade-offs and objectives mixing
                  statistical loss over the whole sample and fairness
                  penalties on categories (which could stem from
                  different values of protected attributes),
                  encompassing partial de-biasing. We do so by
                  adopting two different but complementary viewpoints:
                  first, we consider a PAC-type setup and derive
                  probabilistic upper bounds involving sample-only
                  information; second, we leverage an asymptotic
                  framework to derive a closed-form limiting
                  distribution for the difference between the
                  empirical trade-off and the true trade-off. While
                  these results provide guarantees for learning
                  fairness metrics across categories, they also point
                  out to the key (but asymmetric) role played by class
                  imbalance. To summarise, learning fairness without
                  having access to enough category-level samples is
                  hard, and a simple numerical experiment shows that
                  it can lead to spurious results.}

                  enables learning from data, identifying patterns,
                  and making automated decisions in a
                  privacy-preserving manner. PFL involves independent
                  training for multiple clients with synchronous
                  aggregation steps. However, the assumptions made by
                  existing works are not realistic given the
                  heterogeneity of clients. In particular, the volume
                  and distribution of collected data vary in the
                  training process, and the clients also vary in their
                  available system configurations, which leads to vast
                  heterogeneity in the system. To address these
                  challenges, we present an \textit{asynchronous}
                  method (AsyPFL), where clients learn personalized
                  models w.r.t. local data by making the most

                  asynchronously. In addition, we also reformulate PFL
                  by unifying both synchronous and asynchronous
                  updating schemes with an asynchrony-related
                  parameter. Theoretically, we show that AsyPFL’s
                  convergence rate is state-of-the-art and provide
                  guarantees of choosing key hyperparameters
                  optimally. With these theoretical guarantees, we
                  validate AsyPFL on different tasks with non-IID and
                  staleness settings. The results indicate that, given
                  a large proportion of irregular clients, AsyPFL
                  excels at empirical performance compared with
                  vanilla PFL algorithms on non-IID and IID cases.}
